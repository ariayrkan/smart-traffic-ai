# Smart Traffic AI – Secure Architecture Prototype

This project demonstrates a security-integrated AI system for managing traffic lights in a simulated smart city.

## Purpose
The goal is not to optimize traffic perfectly, but to study AI-specific security risks such as:
- Sensor spoofing
- Data poisoning
- Unsafe automation

## Architecture
The system is composed of:
- Sensor input simulation
- AI decision logic
- Security monitoring
- Traffic controller with safe fallback mode

## Execution
This code is designed as a simple, executable skeleton for Milestone 1.
